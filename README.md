Problem:
Sudesh Sharma is a Linux expert who wants to have an online system where he ca handle student queries. Since there can be multiple requests at a time he wishes to dedicate a fixed amount of time to every request so that every one gets a fair share of his time. He will log into the system from 10AM to 12AM only. He wants to have separate requests queues for students and faculty. Implement a strategy for the same. The summary at the end of the session should include the total time he had sepent on handling queries and average query time.
